# Habitile

Habitiles were ESP32 based devices with an atttached ePaper display, which would interface via bluetooth and/or WiFi with a phone app. These devices were envisioned as a solution for those with ADHD or those who otherwise find it difficult to establish or maintain good habits to be reminded at various times to do whatever the user had programmed.

The specific pin outs in the code are meant for the specific hardware I was working with, but the libraries are common and the code could be adapted to different ESP32 based boards and/or ePaper displays. I did design a custom PCB which had 4 push buttons to control the on screen menu as well as other components. One day I hope to tinker on this project again, but if this code can be of any use to you in a personal project, feel free to use it
